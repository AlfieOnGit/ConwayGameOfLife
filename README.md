# Alfie's Conway Game of Life
This program was my submission for a coursework for the module "Advanced Programming for Games".
I've published it as a demonstration of my C++ coding (and because it's better than letting it
rot on private to never be seen again). However this was written 2-4 weeks after I started to learn
C++ so I'm sure I'd have done it slightly differently now.

## "Question numbers"
Question 1 was about building an environment that can randomly generate an example beginning layout
and then progress through it slowly.

Question 2 and 3 are about shape recognition. They both keep randomly generating new grids and
attempting to find certain patterns. 2 looks for still life ("blocks" and "beehives") whereas 3
looks for oscillators ("blinkers" and "toads").
